# Config File Setup for LUNA Assist

## üìå Purpose of `config.py`
The `config.py` file is used to store API keys and configuration settings needed for LUNA Assist to function properly. The most important setting here is the Hugging Face API key, which is required for AI-generated responses.

## üöÄ How to Set Up the Hugging Face API Key

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Hugging Face Account**
- Visit [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).
- Click **Sign Up** to create an account or **Log In** if you already have one.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Generate an API Token**
- After logging in, go to **Settings** > **Access Tokens**.
- Click **New Token**.
- Choose the scope as **Read**.
- Click **Generate Token**.
- Copy the generated token.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Add the API Token to `config.py`**
- Open `config.py` in any text editor.
- Replace `your_huggingface_api_key_here` with the token you copied.

Example:
```python
HUGGING_FACE_API_URL = "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill"
HUGGING_FACE_API_TOKEN = "hf_youractualapikey"  # Replace with your actual API token
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {HUGGING_FACE_API_TOKEN}"}
```

## üìå Why is This API Key Required?
- The Hugging Face API allows LUNA Assist to process **natural language queries** and generate intelligent responses.
- Without this key, LUNA won't be able to fetch AI-generated replies.

---

## ‚ùó Important Notes
- Keep your API key **private** and **do not share it**.
- If your key gets exposed, **revoke it** in Hugging Face settings and generate a new one.
- Free-tier tokens may have usage limits; consider upgrading if needed.

Now you‚Äôre all set to use LUNA Assist with AI-powered responses! üé§üöÄ
